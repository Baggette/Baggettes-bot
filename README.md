# Baggettes-bot
My first attempt at a discord bot. Things may break

make a bot on the discord devolper portal and place your token in the .env file. \n
to run this bot cd into the directory that has the files and run `npm install discord.js` and `npm install pretty-ms` (make sure npm is installed).
\n then node index.js
