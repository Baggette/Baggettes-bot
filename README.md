# Baggettes-bot
My first attempt at a discord bot. Things may break

If you just want to add the bot [click this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=928069129892663347&permissions=137509588038&scope=bot)
To self host the bot you must first make a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Make a new application on the portal
 step 2
Name it whatever you want
 step 3
go to the bot tab
 step 4

 step 5
Click yes do it
 step 6
Click reset token and copy the token for later
 step 7
Download a zip of this project or git clone it
 step 8 (only if you downloaded a zip)
unzip the file you just downloaded
 step 9 
cd into the directory
 step 10
run `npm i`
wait for it to finish
 step 11 
edit the .env file and replace YOUR BOTTOKEN HERE with your bot toke, save and run `node .` and you should be set
