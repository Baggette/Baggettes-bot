# Baggettes-bot
My first attempt at a discord bot. Things may break

make a bot on the discord devolper portal and place your token in the .env file.
to run this bot cd into the directory that has the files and run `npm install` (make sure npm is installed).
then node index.js to invite the bot (click this link)[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=928069129892663347&permissions=137509588038&scope=bot]
